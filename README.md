- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @glerique
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in PHP and Symfony  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Symfony UX

<p>I started PHP back in 2004, and even back then, people kept telling me it had no future, that it was doomed to die ! </p>
<p>Well, here I am, over 20 years later, still happily coding with my favorite blue elephant.</p> 
<p>Guess who's still standing ?</p>
